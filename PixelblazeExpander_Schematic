# Pixelblaze Output Expander Fritzing Schematic

Below is a description of how you would wire up the system in Fritzing.  
This is a text representation—if you need the actual `.fzz` Fritzing file, let me know and I can guide you through the steps or provide a downloadable example.

## **Components Needed**
- **Pixelblaze controller**
- **4x STM32F103C8T6 “Blue Pill” boards**
- **32x LED strips (WS2812 or similar, up to 15 LEDs each)**
- **Power supply (5V, sized for total LED current)**
- **Jumper wires**
- **330–470Ω resistor for each data line**
- **1000µF capacitor for each strip’s power input**

## **Fritzing Connections**

### **Pixelblaze Serial Output**
- **Pixelblaze TX** → **PA10 (RX1) on each Blue Pill**
- **Pixelblaze GND** → **GND on each Blue Pill**

### **Blue Pill Board 1 (Channels 0–7)**
- **PA0 → LED Channel 0 Data In**
- **PA1 → LED Channel 1 Data In**
- **PA2 → LED Channel 2 Data In**
- **PA3 → LED Channel 3 Data In**
- **PA4 → LED Channel 4 Data In**
- **PA5 → LED Channel 5 Data In**
- **PA6 → LED Channel 6 Data In**
- **PA7 → LED Channel 7 Data In**

### **Blue Pill Board 2 (Channels 8–15)**
- **PB0 → LED Channel 8 Data In**
- **PB1 → LED Channel 9 Data In**
- **PB2 → LED Channel 10 Data In**
- **PB3 → LED Channel 11 Data In**
- **PB4 → LED Channel 12 Data In**
- **PB5 → LED Channel 13 Data In**
- **PB6 → LED Channel 14 Data In**
- **PB7 → LED Channel 15 Data In**

### **Blue Pill Board 3 (Channels 16–23)**
- **PA8 → LED Channel 16 Data In**
- **PA9 → LED Channel 17 Data In**
- **PA10 → LED Channel 18 Data In** *(Don’t use PA10 for output if it’s the RX pin!)*
- **PA11 → LED Channel 19 Data In**
- **PA12 → LED Channel 20 Data In**
- **PA13 → LED Channel 21 Data In**
- **PA14 → LED Channel 22 Data In**
- **PA15 → LED Channel 23 Data In**

*(You may want to skip PA10 and use another available output pin for channel 18, such as PB8.)*

### **Blue Pill Board 4 (Channels 24–31)**
- **PB8 → LED Channel 24 Data In**
- **PB9 → LED Channel 25 Data In**
- **PB10 → LED Channel 26 Data In**
- **PB11 → LED Channel 27 Data In**
- **PB12 → LED Channel 28 Data In**
- **PB13 → LED Channel 29 Data In**
- **PB14 → LED Channel 30 Data In**
- **PB15 → LED Channel 31 Data In**

## **Power Distribution**

- Each LED strip gets 5V and GND from the main power supply.
- Place a **330–470Ω resistor** between each STM32 data output and LED strip data input.
- Add a **1000µF capacitor** across 5V/GND at the start of each LED strip.

---

## **Important Notes**

- **Common Ground:** All Blue Pills, Pixelblaze, and LED strips must share a common ground.
- **Serial Data:** Pixelblaze TX is connected in parallel to all four Blue Pills’ RX pins (PA10).
- **Power:** Do not power LED strips from the Blue Pill directly; use an external 5V supply.

## **Fritzing Steps**

1. Place one Pixelblaze, four Blue Pills, and 32 LED strips in your Fritzing project.
2. Wire Pixelblaze TX to each Blue Pill PA10 (RX1).
3. Connect each Blue Pill’s output pins to its assigned LED strips' data input, with a series resistor.
4. Connect power supply 5V and GND to all LED strips.
5. Add capacitors at the power input of each strip.
6. Connect all grounds together.
